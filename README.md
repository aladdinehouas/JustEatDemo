# JustEat Demo Project 

[![N|JustEat Demo](https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Just-Eat-Logo.png)](https://www.justeattakeaway.com/)

- ✨Welcome ✨

## Main Architecture

In this demo, I used the VIPER architecture.
In fact, I'm a big fan of the VIPER architecture since it separates the UI from background code and makes code testable and maintainable.
I focused on the structure and code style/readability.

##  Third-party Libraries
- MBProgressHUD : Used to display Activity Indicator in an elegant way and to block user interaction while loading.


## What could be improved

- Add more comments to my project files.
- Implement some UI tests.
- Add a details informations about a selected restaurant screen 

## JustEat Demo Functionalities

- The app shows restaurants list in a TableView
- The app shows some informations about the restaurants such as name, rating, distance, delivery costs, etc.
- user can filter restaurants using the search field bar.
- user can sort restaurants by many options such as alphabet, open state, rating average, distance, etc.
- the app retains the selected sort option when the app is killed

> Note: `JustEat Demo Project design` is inspired by the JustEat app.
